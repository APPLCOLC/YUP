removed tempsave, as reading and writing to files should be strictly limited
removed all instances of tempsave being used, as variables in RAM will be the better option for usage
removed the level formation feature, and replaced it with randomly generated levels 
this means the game will run infinitely and will never have duplicate settings_keys_images
intensity will rise as you progress through levels
changed controls (shoot/confirm is j, switch/back is k, pause is i, shield is h)
moved player to characters folder
cleaned up some image storage
(UNFINISHED) added ability to change worlds
changed game size to 450x600
