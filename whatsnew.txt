-Change character entrance states (Completed [NOPE ONLY] 1/21/23)
--start with nope, move onto others later
--make them follow a formula to make them jump on formulaic
--make them shoot as they go on, so it's more of a distraction
-Change character animation states (completed 1/19/23)
--STOP USING THE TIME MODULE
-Change character arguments (completed 1/19/22)
--make it a dictionary, so unneeded arguments can be passed on without issue
-Change default bullets to use generated circles (completed 1/23/22)
--self explantory - unneeded image bloat


-ENTRANCE PSEUDOCODE

-make a function called "move to formation" that makes the character slowly move back to their place in the formation
--this is important because the formulaic entrance will not zap them immediately to the screen


NOPE will be an example

He will have either a "left" or "right" variation of the function, which is randomly selected
It will be a parabola function, with the vertex either being 25,400 or 425,400,
    and the character will start at 0,400 or 450,400 to make a dipping effect
When NOPE hits the height of roughly 100 or less, call the "move to formation" function.

Every frame in the animation will be recorded, with a list of frames where the character will shoot bullets.
The higher the level, the more bullets there will be.
