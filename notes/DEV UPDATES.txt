12/15/22 - 0.3.1 update
-Options: now use a dictionary for universal usage and simple feature addition; originally a bunch of hard-coded lists that had deserved the upgrade.
-optimization.py was fully removed due to a memory leak it created. By making a new sprite class for display, it was making a new class *every frame*, lagging the game. 
-Content: added enemies: fihs, stickman, spike
-Bullets: Nerfed YUP to only shoot 2 bullets at once; removed bees
-Audio: songs are no longer preloaded, and are loaded as an on-needed basis; this saves RAM, as most audio files are mp3 now; all songs are newer, smaller-sized remakes.
-LARGE: put all states and most modules into one file, making main.py over 1200 lines.
-LARGE: Sounds are now one class entity. This makes it so sounds are still only loaded once.
-optimized the formation attack() function to include less loops, as the previous method was very buggy

10/18/22 - 0.3.0 update
(sorry for the long hiatus I forgot about this file)
-characters are now in space-invaders-like formations
-backgrounds are pre-loaded
-audio is pre-loaded
-enemies shoot bullets and are completely re-written
-enemy files are modular
-world files are modular, and load everything modularly
-game now takes 1/6 of the RAM it initially used
-formations now move at a set speed and will move up and down in a sine wave

6/3/22 - item update
-You no longer have all the tools at the start of the game
-You need to earn them mid-level
-They are programmed in the level code

6/2/22 - large update
-Fixed loading duplicate items (not 100% but mostly)
-Added healthbar at top
-Added level select
-Removed foreground and extra assets due to optimization problems
-characters will now pop upon death

4/13/22 - Small update
-Hurt invincibility
-Slight animation fix
-Slight optimization
-Planet glitch fix
   -(basically planets could get stuck in place or go backwards)
-Fixed boss insta-death glitch

4/8/22 - FINALLY
-I fixed that damnned shooting bug.
-The default bullet no longer shoots twice.

4/1/22 - small update
-Bugfixes
-Optimization
-"plug-and-play" for developer assets (only important for me)

3/30/22 - large update
-Pause menu
-GameOver screen
    -Menu goes with BPM

3/28/22 - OPTIONSTATE FIXED
-There was a bug within optionstate that caused the game to repeatedly refresh
-This was caused by a line of code that applied the settings *every frame*
-I had to do a lot of work to figure out a way to fix this issue, but I eventually figured out a way
-The "way" in question was saving the original settings and only applying them if the original settings were different from the current ones

3/11/22 - LEVELCOMPLETESTATE CREATED
-When a level finishes, there is now a state that can be initialized that allows the game to show your total score, your health, and your next level.
-This means the game is now roughly playable if the levels are able to code in the ability to tell the game a level has ended
-On top of that, I also believe that the levels may be able to be more optimized.
-Perhaps the game may be able to read leveldata from a text file instead of having a plethora of inputs?
-That would make things much easier...

3/8/22 - OPTIMIZED CHARACTER SPAWNING
-There is now one universal function for spawning enemies
-This stops you from having to repeatedly look for character spawn conditions, excluding specialized code
-This also lines up SCORE for the chopping block

3/1/22 - LOADING SCREEN UPDATED
-Having a full image take up the screen when loading is a bit disorienting at times, and I have chosen to only use that upon startup.
-Due to this, I have replaced the state change code to simply have a little icon appear in the bottom right corner when loading.
2/28/22 - LOADING SCREEN ADDED
-When the game is booting up, a loading screen is now added in order to fix issues relating to the screen being unresponsive.

2/25/22 - MISSILE TRACKING IMPROVEMENT
-Made it so the tracking bullets have a higher chance of hitting their target. It is now more than likely to hit. 

2/24/22 - BULLET PREVIEW (BEGINNING OF UI)
-YUP is now able to select what bullet he wants to shoot, from selecting items within his inventory list.
    -Items can be added
    -Items can be removed
-Not just that, but the current selected bullet is now previewed in the top left corner of the stage.
-This is the beginning of UI implementation

2/22/22 - ERROR SCREEN
-There are now error screens that appear if an exception occurs.
-There are two types: A Geneal Exception, and a Fatal Exception.
    -A general exception has a little graphic, along with some writing and the actual error at hand.
    -A Fatal Exception blacks out the screen and fully crashes the game.
-Either way, they display an error without fully crashing the game.

2/8/22 - SOUNDS IN PROGRESS
-The sounds within the game are too normal
-I am currently bitcrushing them in order to make it seem more old
-FIXED SOUNDS: all bap noises, ouch, death, boss hurt, enemy death
-IN PROGRESS: bees, woosh

2/4/44 - NEW ENEMIES ADDED
-BIGBOSS goes through four separate phases, all of which go with the new Character Engine
-NYOOM uses the old character engine, since it uses Spike's code. He waits to be near the center of the screen, before quadrupling his speed, playing a noise as he does so.

1/31/22 - OPTIMIZATION DILEMMA
I have currently left the game to load every single sprite as soon as the game begins, typically just so they would all load in an organized manner.
However, despite this, I believe this may bog the game down as time goes on.
This leaves one choice. Do I let the enemies only load the images when they're spawned, or do I make them all preload, as I have been doing?

1/27/22 - BULLET RECOGNITION
-Enemy bullet recognition has changes
-It no longer detects bullet type for deleting bullets, and it only deletes the bullet itself if "piercing" is set to false.
-There will also be a piercing "health" at some point.

1/25/22 -BuLLETS AND LASER ISSUE FIXED
-Extra bullets have been added!
	-The Quad Shot shoots in all four directions
		-Pulls code from the Spike
	-The Laser rips through opponents and never deletes
	-The Missile targets a random enemy and lunges towards it
		-Pulls code from the pirahna
	-The BEES spazz out across the screen!
		-Long lasting
		-Annoying to enemies
		-More likely to kill spikes early
		-Anihilates NOPEs

1/19/22 - MERGING ENEMY CLASSES
-Instead of making an enemy class for each and every enemy that is created, there will be a universal enemy sprite that will do damage. 
-These will be called "HurtSprites" and that is exactly what they will do. 
-I plan to do the same with bulletsprites, however they are already called bulletsprites so there is no point of changing them.

1/18/22 - LEVEL PROGRAMMING BEGINS
- Added the ability for playstate to read from a file
- Needs more work
	- Auto-reading for any level to be added without help

1/14/22 - BACKGROUND SCROLL AUTOMATION
-The game is now able to detect the overall size of an image and automatically tell when to begin stacking images and when not to. 

1/13/22 - BACKGROUND SCROlL LAG ISSUE FIXED
-Backgrounds now "stack" on top of one-another
-If the image being used will now be displayed twice, both at different coordinates, in order to stop the game from having a missing blank spot as a background
-The top left corner of the screen is a y-coordinate of 0, and the higher up you go, the lower the image appears on the screen
	-Knowing this, if an image hits 0 while scrolling, it begins to disappear off stage
-Because of this, any background that hits 0 will be passed off to a sub-method, and a new background gets passed to the main method.
-The pattern continues

1/10/22 - UPDATE
-Converted background registering to its own file
-Put YUP inside of the characters file for the sake of saving space
-Song volume fixed

1/4/22 - 0.1.0
-Yay
