changed UI_images to be an object of a class instead of a class; removed errorstate as it is unused; options only applies settings when P is pressed; added a cmd value for debug purposes that uses exec() (this allows for remote code execution but it's for debug who cares it'll be gone in the next release); fixed bullet display images to take a preloaded image instead of loading one every frame; etc.
