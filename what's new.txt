removed tempsave, as reading and writing to files should be strictly limited
removed all instances of tempsave being used, as variables in RAM will be the better option for usage
removed the level formation feature, and replaced it with randomly generated levels 
this means the game will run infinitely and will never have duplicate settings_keys_images

YET TO IMPLEMENT (most important -> least important)
-rising intensity as each world is cleared
--lowering the time between character throwdowns
--rising the maximum amount of characters
--rising the amount of characters thrown during a throwdown

-transitions from world to world, including bg, music, imports, etc.
-bosses to finish a world after enog levels have been cleared
