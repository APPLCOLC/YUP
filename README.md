**WELCOME TO YUP!**

---LOG: 3/9/2023---
- To be honest, after working on this game and undergoing a few optimization revisions over the course of the past year now, I believe now is the best time to have a redo of YUP. 
- I need to put optimization first and make a good shell of a game first instead of inputting features.
- The game will be redone from the ground up with pseudocode, rough implementation, and then making everything look pretty at the end.
- I find it far more fun to make the system outline first. 
- That means this is the last update of rev C, moving onto rev D.
